What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I helped solve the problem of creating software for ABC University (ABCU) to support their advisors in more efficiently accessing course information for computer science students.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To meet ABC University's requirement for quick access to course information, I decided to use a hash method to store course data. This approach allowed for fast lookups based on the course number. I developed a user-friendly interface that used a simple menu to enable advisors to load data, print course lists, and retrieve specific course details. By leveraging my understanding of data structures, I optimized the solution to meet the university's needs efficiently and effectively.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by running frequent tests when I wrote my code, asking for advice, and sometimes taking a breather!
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Throughout this course and project, I feel my understanding of structures, algorithms, and menus is being expanded.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has emphasized the importance of modular design, clear code organization, and meaningful variable naming to enhance program maintainability, readability, and adaptability.
